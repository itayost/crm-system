- Works with capacity for 3-4 large or 6-7 small projects simultaneously
- Needs efficient time management and accurate project tracking
- Requires fast lead response (< 2 hours)
- Manages recurring maintenance payments (30-300₪ monthly/yearly)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT strategy and credentials provider
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with Prisma ORM
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Charts**: Recharts for analytics
- **Notifications**: Sonner for toast notifications
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with RTL support, Hebrew font (Heebo)

- **JWT Sessions**: 30-day session duration with secure token management
- **Role-Based Access**: User roles (OWNER, ADMIN, USER) defined in schema
- **Credentials Provider**: Email/password authentication with bcrypt hashing

### Database Schema Highlights

The system manages interconnected entities:

1. **Lead Management**
   - Sources: WEBSITE, PHONE, WHATSAPP, REFERRAL, OTHER
   - Status pipeline with conversion tracking
   - Lead-to-client conversion with history

2. **Project Lifecycle**
   - Types: LANDING_PAGE, WEBSITE, ECOMMERCE, WEB_APP, MOBILE_APP, MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM, CONSULTATION
   - Multi-stage tracking: PLANNING → DEVELOPMENT → TESTING → REVIEW → DELIVERY → MAINTENANCE
   - Priority levels: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT
   - Time and budget tracking

3. **Payment System**
   - One-time and recurring payments
   - Automatic reminders (30 days before renewal)
   - Payment status tracking: PENDING, PAID, OVERDUE, CANCELLED
   - Service types for maintenance contracts

4. **Time Tracking**
   - Project and task-level time entries
   - Timer functionality for real-time tracking
   - Duration calculations and reporting

5. **Activity & Notifications**
   - Activity logging for audit trails
   - Notification system for deadlines, payments, and tasks
   - Metadata storage for flexible tracking

### Key Features Implementation

1. **Priority Scoring System**
   - 40% weight: Time to deadline
   - 30% weight: Project monetary value
   - 20% weight: Client type (VIP/Regular/One-time)
   - 10% weight: Task status

2. **Automated Workflows**
   - New lead → WhatsApp notification + 24-hour follow-up task
   - 3 days post-quote → Follow-up reminder
   - Project completion → Payment request
   - Week after delivery → Maintenance offer
   - Month after delivery → Review request

3. **Hebrew/RTL Support**
   - Full RTL layout with `dir="rtl"` and `lang="he"`
   - Hebrew UI labels and messages
   - Israeli date format (DD/MM/YYYY)
   - Week starts on Sunday
   - Currency in ILS (₪)

### Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `DIRECT_URL`: Direct database URL for migrations
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: JWT encryption secret
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Application URL for auth callbacks

Optional integrations:
- WhatsApp Business API credentials
- Webhook secrets for external integrations
- Email service configuration

### Development Approach

1. **Code Style**: Clean, typed TypeScript with proper error handling
2. **Component Structure**: Modular, reusable components following shadcn/ui patterns
3. **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with Zod validation
4. **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Query for server state caching
5. **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod schemas for type-safe validation
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages

### Performance Considerations

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields (status, createdAt, etc.)
- Prisma query optimization with selective includes
- React Query caching for reduced API calls
- Proper loading states and optimistic updates
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component

### Business Logic Highlights

1. **Lead Response Time**: Critical < 2 hour response target
2. **Project Duration Estimates**:
   - Landing page: 3-5 days
   - Website: 2-3 weeks
   - E-commerce: 4-6 weeks
   - Web app: 4-8 weeks
   - Native app: 8-12 weeks
   - Management system: 6-10 weeks
   - Consultation: 1-5 hours

3. **Payment Automation**:
   - Day 0: Payment due reminder
   - Day 7: Second reminder
   - Day 14: Final warning
   - Day 17: Service suspension for maintenance contracts
